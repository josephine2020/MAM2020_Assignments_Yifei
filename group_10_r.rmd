# Question 1
**a**: "<-" operator is the one I would use for assignment  
**b**: When "=" and "<-" are used in creating an argument for a function, variable created by "<-" will be in the user's workspace while the one created by "==" will not.  # this is not a difference between = and <-, this is a difference between == and <-.
**b**: The <- operator has higher precedence over the = operator.
**c**: Variable names must not start with special characters or numbers. Reserved words cannot be used as variable names.  
**d**: Default numeric data type is _double_. 200 is interpreted as a __double__. 
```{r, example for 1d}
typeof(200)
```
**e**: There are numeric, character, integer and logical. Yes because it consists of only atmoic types that cannot be further divided. # integer is a subset of numeric, thus not a type on its own.
**e**: The 4 basic data types are: character, numeric, complex and logical. It is correct to say string "I love LBS" is an atomic vector, because it is a character atomic vector of length 1.

# Question 2
**a**: x < y < z will be evaluated as x < y & y < z  # it will not be evaluated that way. It would lead to an error.
**a**: The correct syntax is: x < y & y < z
**b**: "==" is equality. "|" is or. "!=" is inequality. "&" is and. ">" is greater than.  
**c**: From highest to lowest:
  *  ==, !==, >
  * &
  * | 
**d**: TRUE & 5 & FALSE & "abc" & TRUE  # This does not properly evaluate the relational operator, 5 and "and" are part of relations
**d**: TRUE | FALSE & TRUE
**e**: (5 == 5) | ("abc" != "abc") & (1 > 0) # this is missing a set of parenthesis to evaluate | vs &
**e**: (5 == 5) | (("abc" != "abc") & (1 > 0))

# Question 3
**a**: 
```{r}
tsla <- c(26150, 29870, 29980, 40740, 83500, 90700, 63000, 95200)
names(tsla) = c('Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4', 'Q5', 'Q6', 'Q7', 'Q8')
print(tsla)
```

**b**
```{r}
n = length(tsla)
tot <- 0
for (i in 1:n){
    tot <- tot + tsla[i]
}
print(tot)
```

**c**: Anything between the bracket after the condition is the codee block while i is the index variable. # could be formulated a bit more clearly
**c**:   
  * {tot <- tot + tsla[i]} is the code block
  * The i in (i in 1:n) is the index variable
